Java basics

This repo contains basic syntax of Java. this is used as a reminder of some exaples that I encontured in learning Java. 
Some of this examples are from books, school examples (San Francisco State University), or made up exaples  for practicing puposes.

Due that some of this code was for learning puposes, there are not many comments in my code. However, some of them are being updated.
