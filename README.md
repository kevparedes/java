Java basics

This repo contains basic syntax of Java. this is used as a reminder of some examples that I encountered in learning Java. 
Some of this examples are from books, school examples (San Francisco State University), or made up examples  for practicing puposes.

Due that some of this code was for learning purposes, there are not many comments in my code. However, some of them are being updated.
